<h1>whether-weather</h1>
<p>This is a weather app designed by Andre Pangoni as part of an assignment for the Higher Diploma in Computer Science 2025 course.
It is a simplified version of a weather website that uses hardcoded database, intended to showcase the UI, navigation, and user interactions, data retrieve and manipulation.</p>
<h2>What the Project Does</h2>
<p>The webpage provides detailed information about the weather:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dashboard: A home page displaying the current weather for the available cities.</li>
<li>City Focus: A page showcasing more detailed weather information for each city.
All cities use the same page structure, dynamically adapting based on the URL parameters.</li>
<li>Favorite Cities: This page is similar to the Dashboard but displays only the user's selected favorite cities.
The Dashboard is reused for this purpose by adding a parameter to the URL.</li>
<li>Settings: A page where the user can customize the website, such as selecting their favorite cities and preferred temperature unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Initially, users can navigate from the Dashboard to each individual city page and the Settings page.
Once a user selects any favorite cities in the Settings, a new menu appears, allowing them to access the Favorite Cities page.
They can either click directly or use a dropdown that appears when hovering over the new menu button to navigate to the individual city page.</p>
<h2>Why the Project is Useful</h2>
<p>This project is a fun and interactive way to explore information about the weather across famous cities.
It is designed to be simple, responsive, and visually appealing, making it a great tool to interact with and get informed about the weather.</p>
